# Valentine's 2024

## Overview

Valentine's 2024 is a whimsical, interactive web application designed to bring a smile to your face this Valentine's Day. Developed with React, this app challenges users in a playful way by asking them, "Will you be my Valentine?" The catch? The "No" button evades your every click, moving across the screen with each attempt. Each click also reveals humorous, persuasive messages, encouraging users to keep playing or finally relent and click "Yes", unleashing a celebratory display of confetti and a joyful message.

## Features

- **Dynamic Interaction**: A "No" button that cleverly avoids being clicked, making each interaction unique.
- **Engaging Responses**: Over 20 custom messages designed to entice, persuade, and humorously plead with the user to reconsider their choice.
- **Celebratory Confetti**: A festive burst of confetti and a warm congratulatory message upon acceptance.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React state management and effect hooks for a seamless user experience.
- **Mobile Responsive Design**: Ensures a great experience across various devices and screen sizes.
